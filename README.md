This is an Android Applicaton which is developed by Kotlin.

This project aims to develop an Android app that allows users
to handwrite in designated boxes and saves the points of the
handwritten characters in a CSV file. The app also uses image
processing techniques to recognize the handwritten
characters and estimate the pressure of the hand. This app
